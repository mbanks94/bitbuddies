# Bit Buddies

**1. Introduction**

Bit Buddies is a Tamagotchi-style virtual pet game where the player cares for a digital creature whose well-being and evolution are directly influenced by the player's Bitbucket activity. The game aims to be a fun and motivating way to encourage consistent coding habits and project management best practices.

**2. Game Overview**

Players adopt a virtual "Buddy" that represents their coding persona or a specific project. The Buddy has needs like Hunger, Happiness, Energy, and Learning, which are affected by the player's actions on Bitbucket (commits, pull requests, issue resolutions, code reviews). By consistently contributing to their projects and maintaining a healthy Bitbucket activity, players keep their Buddy happy, evolve it into new forms, and unlock rewards.

**3. Gameplay Mechanics**

- **Pet Needs:**
  - **Hunger:** Decreases over time. Replenished by making commits (representing "feeding" the Buddy with code). Different commit sizes/types provide varying levels of nourishment.
  - **Happiness:** Affected by successful pull requests (representing collaboration and positive feedback), closing issues (representing bug fixes and problem-solving), and code reviews (representing mentorship). Rejected pull requests or unresolved issues can negatively impact happiness.
  - **Energy:** Decreases with activity. Replenished by consistent daily/weekly commits (representing regular work habits). Overwork (too many commits in a short period) can lead to fatigue.
  - **Learning:** Increases with successful pull requests, code reviews (both giving and receiving), and issue resolution. Represents the Buddy's growth and skill development.
- **Bitbucket Actions:**
  - **Commits:** Replenish Hunger. Size and content of commits have varying effects.
  - **Pull Requests:** Affect Happiness and Learning. Successful merges boost both; rejections slightly lower Happiness.
  - **Issues:** Affect Happiness, Energy, and Learning. Closing issues boosts all three. Unresolved issues can negatively impact Happiness and Energy.
  - **Code Reviews:** Affect Happiness and Learning. Providing helpful reviews boosts both.
- **Evolution:** As the Buddy's needs are consistently met and Learning increases, it evolves into new forms with unique appearances and abilities. Evolutions could unlock new mini-games, world interactions, or customization options.
- **World Interactions:** The Buddy lives in a small virtual world that can be personalized. The vibrancy and state of the world can reflect the player's project's "health" (positive Bitbucket activity leads to a thriving world).
- **Mini-Games:** Include mini-games related to coding concepts (e.g., debugging puzzles, code refactoring challenges) to provide variety and further boost Learning.
- **Social Features:** Allow players to share their Buddies with friends. Considering collaborative challenges or leaderboards.

**4. Bitbucket Integration**

- **Real-time Updates:** The game should ideally pull real-time data from the Bitbucket API to dynamically influence the Buddy's needs and the world.
- **Metric Mapping:** Carefully map Bitbucket metrics to the Buddy's needs (as described above).
- **Authentication:** Secure user authentication with Bitbucket is essential (OAuth 2.0 recommended, preferably via a backend service).
- **Rate Limiting:** Implement strategies to avoid exceeding Bitbucket API rate limits.

**5. Visuals and User Interface**

- **Charming Pet Design:** Visually appealing and engaging Buddy designs are crucial.
- **Intuitive UI:** Clear display of the Buddy's needs, Bitbucket activity, and world interactions.
- **Notifications:** Gentle reminders to care for the Buddy and contribute to projects.
- **World Design:** A vibrant and customizable world that reflects project health.

**6. Sound Design**

- **Sound Effects:** Appropriate sound effects for actions, notifications, and mini-games.
- **Music:** Background music that complements the game's mood.

**7. Acheivements**

- **Cosmetics:** Unlock cosmetic items for the Buddy and its world (e.g., different outfits, decorations).
- **New Pets:**

**8. Target Audience**

- Developers of all skill levels who use Bitbucket for their projects.
- Individuals looking for a fun and motivating way to improve their coding habits.

**9. Platform**

- Initial target platform: Desktop
- Potential for cross-platform support.
